1. What would happen if you used notify() instead of notifyAll()?
If I only use notify(), it might wake up the wrong thread, like another producer instead of a consumer. 
That could cause both sides to keep waiting and the program might freeze. notifyAll() wakes up everyone so
the right one can grab the lock and keep things going.

2. Why must wait() be called inside a while loop instead of an if statement?
When a thread wakes up from wait(), things might have changed while it was asleep. Using while makes it check
the condition again before running. If I use if, it only checks once, which can cause errors or wrong behavior 
if the condition isn’t true anymore.

3. What would happen if the produce() method wasn’t synchronized?
If it wasn’t synchronized, two or more producer threads could add to the buffer at the same time. That could 
mess up the list, or go over the buffer limit, or make the program crash because multiple threads would change it at once.

4. What happens if you forget to call notifyAll() in the produce() method?
The consumer threads wouldn’t wake up when there’s new data to use. They would just sit there waiting forever even 
though the buffer isn’t empty anymore so my program would basically hang.

5. Why does wait() release the lock? What would happen if it didn’t?
wait() releases the lock so other threads can work and change the condition i'm waiting for. If it didn’t
release the lock, no other thread could get in to fix the problem and everything would get stuck forever.
